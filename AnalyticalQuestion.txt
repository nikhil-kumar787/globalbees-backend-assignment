Question 2
There is a Singles table tennis tournament, a total of 32 players participated in the tournament. If a player is eliminated as soon as the player loses a match. How many matches are required to declare the winner?

A-Lets say we first have 16 matches, it will eliminate 16 persons.
Next we have 8 matches it will further eliminate 8 persons, leaving with us 8.
Next we again have 4 matches, leaving 4 persons.
Next 2 matches, leaving two finalists, and 1 match in finalist will decide the winner.

Thus a total of 16+8+4+2+1 = 31 matches will be needed to declare the winner.


Question 3
You have 8 balls all look identical (in shape, color etc.). All of them have same weight except one defective ball which is heavier than others. You can use a two sided balance system (not the electronic one). Find the minimum no. of measures required to separate the defective ball.
A- Divide 8 balls into groups of 3, 3 and 2.

First weigh :
Weigh the two groups of 3 ball, now there are two possibilities
a) They are balanced (all 6 balls are of equal weight)
b) One side is heavier then the other.

case (a) :
The group of 2 has the defective ball. Weigh them with one on each side of balancing machine. The side which has more weigh has the heavier/defective ball.

case (b) :
We got the three balls of the side which is heavier. Now take any two balls and weigh them, then again there are two cases.
(i) They both are of equal weight.
(ii) One is heavier than the other.

for case (b)(i) :
The third ball is heavier/defective than all other balls

for case (b)(ii) :
The heavier ball is defective.
